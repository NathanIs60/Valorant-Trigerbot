## üéØ First Time Setup

### When you first open the application:

1. **Status Panel**: Shows "INACTIVE" with red indicator
2. **Color Configuration**: Default purple color (RGB 128,0,128)
3. **Tolerance**: Set to 60% by default
4. **Parameters**: Scan interval 1ms, Click cooldown 50ms

### Quick Start Steps:

1. **Choose Your Target Color**
   - Click "Choose Color" button
   - Select any color from the picker
   - Or keep the default purple

2. **Adjust Tolerance**
   - Use the slider to set similarity threshold
   - 60% works well for most colors
   - Higher = more lenient, Lower = more strict

3. **Start Detection**
   - Click "START DETECTION" button
   - Status changes to "ACTIVE" with green indicator
   - The system begins monitoring 9 central pixels

4. **Monitor Activity**
   - Watch the Activity Log for real-time events
   - Check Statistics panel for performance metrics
   - Adjust parameters as needed

## üé® Color Detection Guide

### How It Works
The application monitors a 3x3 grid (9 pixels) at the center of your screen and detects colors similar to your target color within the specified tolerance.

### Target Colors
- **Purple** (default): RGB(128,0,128)
- **Red**: RGB(255,0,0)
- **Green**: RGB(0,255,0)
- **Blue**: RGB(0,0,255)
- **Custom**: Use color picker for any color

### Tolerance Settings
- **20-40%**: Very strict matching
- **40-60%**: Moderate matching (recommended)
- **60-80%**: Loose matching
- **80-100%**: Very loose matching

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Detection Parameters
- **Scan Interval**: How fast to check pixels (1-100ms)
- **Click Cooldown**: Delay between clicks (10-1000ms)

### Performance Settings
- **Low CPU Mode**: Increase scan interval to 10ms+
- **High Precision**: Decrease scan interval to 1-5ms
- **Balanced**: Keep default 1ms scan, 50ms cooldown

### Save/Load Settings
- **Save Config**: Stores all current settings to file
- **Load Config**: Restores previously saved settings
- **Reset Stats**: Clears all statistics counters

- üü¢ **Green Circle**: Detection active
- **Screen Info**: Shows resolution and center point

### Statistics Panel
- **Runtime**: How long detection has been active
- **Detections**: Number of color matches found
- **Clicks**: Number of automated actions performed
- **Avg Scan**: Average time per pixel scan

### Activity Log
- Real-time event logging
- Timestamped entries
- Error messages and status updates
- Color detection notifications

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No detections occurring"
- ‚úÖ Check if detection is started (green indicator)
- ‚úÖ Verify target color is correct
- ‚úÖ Increase tolerance percentage
- ‚úÖ Make sure target color is visible on screen

#### "High CPU usage"
- ‚úÖ Increase scan interval to 10ms or higher
- ‚úÖ Close unnecessary applications
- ‚úÖ Check system resources

#### "Application won't start"
- ‚úÖ Run as administrator if needed
- ‚úÖ Check Windows compatibility
- ‚úÖ Verify file isn't corrupted

### Performance Tips
- Use scan intervals ‚â•5ms for better performance
- Set click cooldown ‚â•50ms to prevent spam
- Monitor statistics to optimize settings
- Save different configs for different scenarios
